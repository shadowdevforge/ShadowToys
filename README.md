  # ShadowToys
  
A collection of self-contained HTML "toys" I build when I'm bored or 
curious about something. Each one is a single HTML file with everything 
embedded - no build process, no dependencies, just download and open.

> **IMPORTANT:** These are toy projects I make in my free time for fun. 
> They're experiments, not production software. Expect bugs, quirks, 
> and sudden rewrites. **Use at your own risk!**


## Philosophy

- **Self-contained**: One file, works offline
- **Catppuccin**: All themed with Catppuccin Macchiato
- **Unserious**: Made for fun, not for profit
- **Experimental**: Trying ideas, learning, breaking things
- **Accessible**: Click link → works immediately


## Usage

1. Click the link above
2. It works immediately
3. View source to see how it's made
4. Download the HTML file to use offline

That's it. No `npm install`, no build process, no configuration.

## Why "Toys"?

Because I'm not taking them seriously, and neither should you. 
They're learning experiments, "what if" explorations, and weekend 
hacks. Some happen to be useful. Some happen to be trash. But they're still toys.

## Tech "Stack"

- Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no frameworks)
- CDN for inline integration of libraries
- Self-contained (everything in one file)
- Modern browser APIs (localStorage, canvas, etc.)
- Catppuccin Macchiato theme (consistent aesthetic)
- Usually made with AI assistance 

## Can I Use These?

Yes! MIT license. Copy, modify, learn from, whatever. 
Just remember they're **toys** - use at your own risk.

## Can I Contribute?

Maybe? These are personal experiments, but if you have a 
fun toy idea that fits the vibe, open an issue and let's chat.

These toys exist because:
- I get bored easily
- I like building things
- Few things is what we do for fun not for Long term support
- I don't want 40 repos cluttering my profile
- One repo for toys > Many repos for toys

## Warning (Again)

They might:
- Have bugs 🐛
- Break randomly 💥
- Get completely rewritten 🔄
- Never be updated again 🪦
- Work perfectly forever ✨

You've been warned!
